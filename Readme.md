# Obsidian Admonition to Callout

An easy way to move from the [Admonition plug-in](https://github.com/valentine195/obsidian-admonition) to the core [Callout functionality](https://help.obsidian.md/Editing+and+formatting/Callouts).

This is an GAWK script.


## Run test

Use the `./test.sh` command to run the tests.
